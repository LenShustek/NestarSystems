The first product of Nestar Systems, released in 1979, was the Cluster/One: a 
networked configuration of up to 15 Commodore PET, Apple ][, and Radio Shack TRS-80 
personal computers. 

The users' computers (called "Drones") were interconnected on the network with a 
daisy-chained 26-wire bus. The file server was a Commodore PET on the network 
(called the "Queen"), which had two 8" 360 KB floppy disks attached. A later 
option for double-sided floppy drives expanded the total file storage to 1.2 MB. 
Support for the Calcomp Marksman 20 MB hard disk drive was implemented, but it
was never [check that] sold as an option.

The software in this directory is of the file server, written in 6502 assembler 
language for the PET computer.

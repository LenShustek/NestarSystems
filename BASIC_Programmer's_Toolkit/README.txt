In August 1979 the Nestar subsidiary "Palo Alto IC's" released the 
"BASIC Programmer's Toolkit", a collection of programming aids for the 
Commodore PET computer distributed as a hardware read-only-memory (ROM). 

Written by Chuck Bond, the original source code for the Toolkit has 
been lost. In 2008 Chuck reconstructed the source code here from a 
disassembly of the ROM. 

The only other offering of Palo Alto IC's was the vending machine 
pictured here that was installed in a local computer store. It dispensed 
a random integrated circuit chip in a plastic container for 50 cents.
It is unclear whether any of its ICs were ever purchased.
